This year, I made a patrician Christmas playlist. It is patrician in that it includes both old favorites along with some more obscure or modern renditions. These aren't in any particular order, but here it is anyway:

| Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town | Bruce Springsteen | 2001 |
| All I Want For Christmas Is You | Mariah Carey | 1994 |
| Do You Hear What I Hear | Bing Crosby | 1963 |
| Let It Snow | Dean Martin | 1945 |
