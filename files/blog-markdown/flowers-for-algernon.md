One of the best science fiction books I've read since high school. Frankly, after a while, I forgot about the science fiction element and just thought of it as a slice-of-life book about a man who has to watch his own decline. Charlie's helplessness was devastating to watch. For me, the most depressing part is near the end of the book when Charlie briefly forgot about everything that had happened and dropped in on Alice's class. Frankly, I don't know what I'd do in Charlie's situation. It might sound macabre, but I think I would strongly consider suicide before I entirely lost my lucidity. RIP Algernon.
