Josh,

To set up your nginx server block, you'll have to do the following:

1. Configure your DNS records to point to this server:

A     |  NAME: WWW  	  | VALUE: [Server's IPv4 Address]
AAAA  |  NAME: WWW  	  | VALUE: [Server's IPv6 Address]
CNAME |  NAME: joshuak.me | VALUE: www.joshuak.me

Note: I recommend using Cloudflare SSL to encrypt your connection. It stops users from being able to SSH into
the server by using your domain.

2. Configure Nginx
    a) Create the directory for your website
	sudo mkdir -p /var/www/joshuak.me/public_html
    b) Create the default page for your domain (for our purposes, this is index.html)
	sudo nano /var/www/joshuak.me/public_html/index.html
	
	<!DOCTYPE HTML>
	    <head>
	      <title>josh's cool website</title>
	    </head>
	  <h3>Social Satire?</h3>
	    <p>Yes, that's right. Some would classify us as politically incorrect, we prefer the term "observant".</p>
	</html>

    c) Change the ownership of all files in your website's directory to www-data, Nginx's user account
	sudo chown -R www-data: /var/www/joshuak.me/
    d) Create your server block
        In your editor of choice (or copy it from here and echo it into the file, since this should just work), 
	type this:
	
	sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/joshuak.me
	
	server {
	    listen 80;
	    listen [::]:80;
	    
	    root /var/www/joshuak.me/public_html;

	    index index.html;

	    server_name joshuak.me www.joshuak.me;

	    access_log /var/log/nginx/joshuak.me.access.log;
	    error_log /var/log/nginx/joshuak.me.error.log;

	    location / {
	        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	    }
	}

    e) Create a symlink from this file to the Nginx enabled directory
	sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/joshuak.me /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    f) Set the new Nginx configuration and make sure there are no errors (errors will echo to the terminal)
	sudo nginx -t
    g) Restart nginx
	sudo systemctl restart nginx
    h) [OPTIONAL] Enable certbot and Let'sEncrypt SSL
	If you choose not to use CloudFlare but still want to use SSL, Let'sEncrypt is a free signing authority
	promoted by the EFF. To enable it for this website, run the following command in terminal:

	sudo certbot --nginx -d joshuak.me -d www.joshuak.me

	certbot will ask you if you want to direct all traffic to https. That's my set up, but it is your call.
	Nginx will automatically reload when you finish the wizard.
