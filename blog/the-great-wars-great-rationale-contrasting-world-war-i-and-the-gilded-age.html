</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Race in America has long been a touchy subject. Landmark decisions on civil rights include slavery in colonial America, its codification in the Constitution, the passage of the imperfect 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, and finally the 1896 landmark decision by the Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson. The Plessy ruling ultimately was a point of contention for nearly 60 years. Its establishment of the Separate But Equal doctrine would lead to racially-backed segregationist policy in the Jim Crow laws1. Following 58 years of this near-apartheid-tier protocols, the SCOTUS came to a new decision in Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka, Kansas: that "[separate] education facilities [were] inherently unequal.2" Though Brown v. Board didn't solve racism in America, it created massive ripple effects through American society at all levels.</p>
<p>The decades between Plessy and Brown v. Board saw sweeping changes in the American psyche when it comes to the perception of African-Americans. Following in the footsteps of pre-Civil War orator Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois argued fiercely against the Atlanta Compromise,3 (despite supporting it early on) struck by Booker T. Washington granting the right to an education and fair trial for black Americans4. Successive arguments by black speakers throughout the Progressive Era would lead to a strengthening of the African-American identity, culminating in the formation of the NAACP in 19095. The zeitgeist of black Americans was quickly dominated by dreams of equality. Unfortunately, the Congress and Executive Branch were preoccupied with two world wars and a Great Depression that quashed the hopes of many colored Americans between 1917 and 1945, but the work and opposition by and of colored Americans and their white allies didn't stop while the government had different priorities.</p>
<p>Following the Great War, black Americans had to grapple with a new Ku Klux Klan and the repercussions of the Atlanta Compromise. In part thanks to the resurgence of the Klan, suburbia became a toxic place for black families to live. Concurrently, colored Americans enjoyed a modern perception of their culture in the'New Negro', spurred on by Washington's writing and DuBoi's open criticism of whites as editor of the NAACP's regular magazine The Crisis6. This 'New Negro' identity was one of a confident, capable person deserving of the same privileges granted to whites. The Great Depression did put civil rights on somewhat of a freeze. Federal employment wouldn't be integrated until 1948, leaving unemployed African-Americans behind during most of FDR's New Deal programs. The Second World War demonstrated major reform not seen during the one from the previous decade. A series of landmark Supreme Court cases and executive orders during the Truman Administration would happen during and after the war that would enfranchise colored Americans in ways that would have been absurd when Plessy was decided7. Glass ceilings for African-Americans were broken in many walks of life, from business to athletics. The first half of the 1950s would prove the most significant in racially integrating the government.</p>
<p>The Cold War ironically correlated with the greatest civil rights reforms yet. The documented steps toward federal integration in the early 50s exist in stark contrast to the tight controls on immigration and the rise of the second Red Scare8. Even ethnic barriers began to dissolve in the four years before Brown v. Board9.The racial divide was maintained, but diversity itself grew remarkably. African-American culture was allowed to prevail across the racial boundary for the first time in the 50s. Though 'black' music was generally opposed in most white households, it was easily brought to the mainstream through white vessels including Elvis Presley10. The uniformity of the 1940s was erased with the Beat movement and the rise of the rebellious teenager, providing young white Americans with access to appreciate what had become of black culture. The cultural changes made over these decades would come to a head on May 17, 1954, where the Supreme Court of the United States decided unanimously that segregation had no place under the Constitution11. Though its implementation would be met with resistance in the deep south, each state eventually capitulated and integrated every one of its public services. Following the decision, the Civil Rights movement expanded to target desegregation in private business, promoting freedom for Americans of all ethnic and racial backgrounds. This wouldn't be the end of racism in America, but it was a rather good start.</p>
<p>Race, religion, and sexuality represent the topics that in American culture remain inappropriate topics of conversation. Had the men and women leading up to the Civil Rights movement not broached the subject of race, it's certain that segregation would remain the law of the land. Key figures from Booker T. Washington and W.E.B Dubois to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. would define the 20th century's strides in civil rights. The Supreme Court of the United States, designed to protect the rights of all Americans, arguably had a less important role of the decision than any of the black men and women who fought for their rights; the NAACP and the organizations and people aligned with it caused the reforms to occur. The idea that what makes an American should be a product of all Americans is no longer a foreign concept, and the events leading up to Brown were the cause of today's diverse, unique, and free culture.</p>
