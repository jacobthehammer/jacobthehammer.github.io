</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Americans are pugnacious. The political landscape is vexing, and it’s not easy to find common ground on the issues we find most important. From debates at Thanksgiving dinner to punditry on cable news, people on both sides of the aisle have been driven to relative extremes in recent years. This divisiveness in part can be attributed to President Ronald Reagan, who in the 1980s reformed the Republican Party under a new era of conservatism. Reagan’s legacy, by many esteemed or derided, was formed throughout his political career. Fundamentally, his promises of a return to form for America and renewed commitment to traditional values were overshadowed by untested economic policy and contradictory foreign policy. These shortcomings led an otherwise popular President to an administration unable to accomplish its goals.</p>
<p>The run-up to Reagan’s election was tumultuous in and of itself. President Carter was facing a crisis of character. He appeared weak on key issues, and his actions didn’t help matters. Carter faced a resistant Congress, but also failed on executive decisions including foreign policy blunders with communist states. Détente with the Soviets, which had been in progress since the Nixon administration, was decimated under Carter. A tumbling economy and energy crisis (exacerbated by the Three-Mile Island incident) crippled his image. Carter’s ‘hail Mary’ took the form of his “Crisis of Confidence” speech, an Oval Office address that only served to point out the flaws in his administration. These faults, among others, setup a prime opening for a novice politician like Reagan to step in and rise to the Presidency. Reagan’s election was chiefly brought by attacks on Carter’s administration and a unification of Evangelicals not seen in the preceding decades. Reagan won handily in 1980, carrying 44 states with a popular vote spread of nearly ten percent over the incumbent Carter.</p>
<p>Following his inauguration, Reagan’s administration immediately turned to reform American culture. As undesirable parts of government were downsized, consumer spending was promoted from the White House. At nearly the quinquagenary of the New Deal, Keynesian economic policy was wholly rejected in favor of supply-side economics. These two policies, Reaganomics paired with consumerism, were expected to push the economy to new heights. Unfortunately, the 1981 recession was only curbed by increased Federal spending that led to a massive Federal deficit. The direct result of Reaganomics was the 1982 wave election that lost the House for Republicans. In spite of this, the economy recovered well, and Reagan coasted to reelection only two years later, defeating Walter Mondale by a wider margin than he had Carter. Reagan’s domestic policy included scandals among environmentalists and workers’ rights advocates. A second crash occurred in October 1987, decimating Reagan’s reputation at home through the end of the year.</p>
<p>Reagan’s foreign policy was in line with that of other early “Cold Warrior” Republican presidents, as it rejected the easing of tensions promoted by Nixon. Though he was a conservative, he did nothing to reduce the size of the military in effective peacetime. As an affront to détente, Reagan increased pressure on all fronts in the Cold War. Deployments of nuclear arms, avoiding international conferences, and supporting rebels in Afghanistan all lead to a chilling of relations between the Soviets and the United States. By 1983, the United States was back to invading sovereign nations to halt the spread of Communism. Ironically, the US promoted decidedly autocratic governments in Central America to stop marxism at all costs. This policy, known as the Reagan Doctrine, led to deployments of American troops in both the Gulf of Mexico and in the Middle East. Flaws in this policy directly led to the Iran-Contra affair, where the Reagan Administration circumvented the US Congress to support rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan did have some overseas victories, specifically his famous call for the Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down” the Berlin Wall, and his work with Gorbachev to reduce the two states’ nuclear arsenals in the late 80s. Reagan’s success with the Soviets at the tail end of his Presidency likely led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, defining the highlight of his administration and of a 40 year long global conflict. Sadly, Reagan’s support of the Mujahideen led to the rise of Osama Bin Laden and the continuing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>As popular a president as Reagan was during his administration, the ripple effects of his presidency have left behind several bad traditions - the defense budget doesn’t decrease in peacetime, increases in the deficit have become routine, and conservative promises to shrink the government should be taken with a grain of salt. Income inequality was worse than it had been in decades during supply-side economics, and is by some metrics worse than ever now. Despite this, the United States was finally able to topple the only superpower, and has been the dominant nation since. Reagan’s transformation of the Republican Party led it to victory in the 1991 election, where his Vice President, George H.W Bush, became president. Despite the numerous flaws in retrospect, Reagan was very popular during his terms and continues to be popular today. It was not Reagan’s personality that was unsuccessful, it was his handling of various strategies and issues that resulted in the shortcomings of his leadership.
